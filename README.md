# Yam

An experimental language with a few goals:
1. First-class IDE support - because IDEs are just as important as plain-text syntax and batch compiling.
2. A powerful type system - with support for compile-time metaprogramming.
3. A focus on low-level, but safe programming, for games and graphics.

Since yam is heavily in development, none of these goals have been realized yet.
